## Abstract

This ZIP defines the protocol for decentralized scientific publishing on the Zoo network.

## Motivation

Traditional academic publishing is slow, expensive, and gatekept. DeSci enables open access and transparent review.

## Specification

### Publishing Flow

1. **Submission**: IPFS-pinned research artifact
2. **Review**: Token-incentivized peer review
3. **Revision**: On-chain revision history
4. **Publication**: Immutable publication record

### Peer Review

Anonymous reviewers stake tokens to ensure quality reviews.

### Citation Graph

On-chain citation tracking for impact measurement.

## Security Considerations

Sybil-resistant identity for author verification.

## Copyright

Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.
