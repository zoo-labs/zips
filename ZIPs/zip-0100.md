## Abstract

This ZIP specifies the protocol for decentralized AI model training on the Zoo network.

## Motivation

Centralized AI training creates power imbalances. Decentralized training democratizes AI development.

## Specification

### Training Modes

1. **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving distributed training
2. **Collaborative Training**: Shared gradient updates
3. **Ensemble Training**: Model diversity optimization

### Compute Rewards

Contributors receive ZOO tokens proportional to verified compute contribution.

## Security Considerations

Differential privacy for training data protection.
